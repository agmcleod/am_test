# agile archer

Agile archer is a 2d game at side scroller perspective. The mechanic will be using a sequence of gestures and input to complete a sequence of moves, dodges and shooting of arrows. The idea will be to allow variety in approach. This will be to take out enemies. The groups of enemies will be in stages, with different set layouts, and will come from all sorts of angles. Ideally these should be designed random, so a lot of hardcoded levels do not have to be made.

- Single frame/no camera layouts
- Designed levels
- Perma death
- Combat is a series of moves. Each move equates to an enemy move. This game includes. Moving to get in position. Time cost will be determined, but thinking 1/3rd of screen is 1 move.
